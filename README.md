# MAGIC

Remote collaborative work has become pervasive in many settings ranging from Engineering to Medical professions. In these fields, 3D virtual models facilitate assessing different solutions without several physical prototypes. However, when discussing shared 3D content in life-sized face-to-face telepresence, mutual awareness decreases due to ambiguities, occlusions, and different viewpoints. We introduce MAGIC, a novel approach to improving pointing agreement in shared workspaces. Participants can communicate through nonverbal cues while sharing the same perspective, integrating task-, person-, and reference-space seamlessly. Our approach distorts the remote participant's gestures to correctly reflect them on the local person's reference space. To evaluate our approach, we introduce the concept of pointing agreement to measure people's ability to accurately understand each other pointing gestures. Results from a VR user study suggest that MAGIC significantly improves pointing agreement in face-to-face collaboration settings. Furthermore, manipulations were unnoticeable, improving co-presence and awareness of interactions performed in the shared space.
